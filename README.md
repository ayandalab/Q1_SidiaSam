Question 1
Write a function solution that, given a string S of N lowercase English letters, returns a string with no instances of three identical consecutive letters, obtained from S by deleting the minimum possible number of letters.
Examples
1.	Given S = “eedaaad”, the function should return “eedaad”. One occurrence of letter a is deleted.
2.	Given S = “xxxtxxx”, the function should return “xxtxx”. Note that letter x can occur more than three times in the returned string, if the occurrences are not consecutive.
3.	Given S = “uuuuxaaaaxuuu”, the function should return “uuxaaxuu”.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
a.	N is an integer within the range [1..200,000];
b.	String S consists only of lowercase letters (a-z).
